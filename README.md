# ProjectBreakdown_HVAC

### An attempt to describe work breakdown using a situation of an HVAC system regulating a "space."

### Prerequisite:
- Basic programming knowledge.
- Object Oriented Programming concepts.

We will start off with the following situation. We have a "space" which for now we will assume is a room. We would like to control the temperature of this room. For that we have a machine that can heat it up or cool it down to the desired temperature.
